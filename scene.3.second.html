<p>She wrote at night, beneath the cover of darkness, when the house was silent, and her husband slept.  
   For her, poetry became the only means of escape — a fragile thread connecting her to freedom, to hope, and to the world beyond her confinement.  
   One night, her secret was uncovered. Her husband discovered the notebook; his rage ignited like fire. He struck her, tore the pages, and locked her away.  
   Yet, what he failed to understand was that the mind cannot be imprisoned. Her thoughts remained free — soaring far beyond the walls he tried to build around her.</p>
